## Cloning Repo
*  Before start testing we need python script for testing. This can can be clonned from the [github profile](https://github.com/dlt-hub/dlt/tree/master/tests/load/pipeline)
*  To clone gitub use the command ```gitclone https://github.com/dlt-hub/dlt.git```
*  Go to your terminal create a folder in the directory. To create a folder use the command ```mkdir <folder_name>```
*  After creating use the ```gitclone``` command
*  Navigate to the clonned folder
*  Use ```ls``` command to list all contents in the directory
*  use ```cd``` to navigate to each folder and use ``` cd ..``` to move backward
  
## Testing python script
* Navigate to the folder ```tests/load/pipeline```
* We can see the python script named ```test_merge_disposition.py```
